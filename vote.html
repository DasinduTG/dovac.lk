            Fonterra Brands Lanka strengthened its commitment to Sri Lanka’s dairy sector with the opening of a new milk collection and chilling centre (MCC) in Hanwella. <span class="dots">...</span>
            <span class="more" style="display:none;"><br><br>Fonterra Brands Lanka strengthened its commitment to Sri Lanka’s dairy sector with the opening of a new milk collection and chilling centre (MCC) in Hanwella. This initiative will directly support hundreds of dairy farmers by providing them with better access to milk collection facilities and support services from Fonterra Brands Lanka. By improving efficiency in milk collection and storage, Fonterra Brands Lanka ensures that more locally sourced, high-quality dairy reaches Sri Lankan households far and wide.
              <br>
              <br>
              Equipped with a 3,000-litre chilling capacity and cutting-edge testing facilities, this new MCC will create greater opportunities for smallholder farmers to produce more milk, while enabling Fonterra Brands Lanka to source the highest quality milk. By investing in infrastructure, technical resources, and improved collection systems, Fonterra Brands Lanka aims to empower farmers with the tools and knowledge needed to enhance their productivity, quality, and livelihoods. This initiative aligns with the company’s long-term goal of strengthening Sri Lanka’s dairy industry through sustainable growth and local partnerships.
              <br>
              <br>
              The opening ceremony was attended by Fonterra’s leadership team, the Divisional Public Health Inspector, the Provincial Secretary, regional surgeons, veterinarians, and field staff from the Department of Animal Production and Health, reflecting the collaborative effort to enhance Sri Lanka’s dairy sector.
              <br>
              <br>
              As part of its ongoing mission to nurture the nation with the goodness of dairy nutrition, Fonterra remains dedicated to uplifting the farming communities that form the backbone of the industry. The Hanwella centre is yet another step towards a more resilient and a sustainable dairy sector. </span>

          <br>
          <p class="card-text zoom-in" style="font-size: 12px;color: black;margin-left: 0px;">
            The domestic market has experienced a surge in coconut prices due to the gap between supply and demand. <span class="dots">...</span>
            <span class="more" style="display:none;"><br><br>The domestic market has experienced a surge in coconut prices due to the gap between supply and demand. As a solution for this, Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) need to be adopted to increase the harvest efficiency in coconut cultivation fields.
              <br>
              <br>
              Accordingly, maintaining spacing among plants, enabling a sufficient amount of sunlight, replacing unproductive trees with new plants, soil conservation through intercropping, pest management, balanced plant nutrition, and efficiency in water management can be considered as the factors for harvest efficiency.
              <br>
              <br>
              Normally, 100-120 coconuts can be harvested annually from a healthy, well-maintained coconut tree in Sri Lanka. For such a harvest outcome, 60 L of water needs to be provided to the tree daily. Over time, when the coconut tree cannot sustain nutrition by itself and soil nutrition depletes, it needs to be outsourced as fertiliser. However, research shows that in Sri Lanka, only 30% of coconut cultivators provide fertiliser and only 10% provide water to the coconut trees. The limited application of water and fertiliser has resulted in an annual yield of 40-60 coconuts from a tree.
              <br>
              <br>
              DIMO Agribusinesses, the agriculture arm of DIMO, has developed a range of solutions for enhancing coconut production from planting coconut trees to coconut harvesting.
              <br>
              <br>
              The prime step for high-quality coconut production is planting high-quality coconut seedlings. DIMO Agribusinesses, a registered provider of high-quality coconut seedlings grown with state-of-the-art technology, supports cultivators with superior planting material.
              <br>
              <br>
              Under the DIMO Fertiliser brand, DIMO Agribusinesses offers a range of fertiliser blends, including YPM-D, YPM-W, APM-D, APM-W, and APM-TSP. In addition to these, it has introduced a specialised fertiliser for coconut cultivation under the Grow Max brand featuring the renowned Nitrophoska compound blend.
              <br>
              <br>
              In addition, DIMO Agribusinesses conducts lab testing for soil analysis to maintain the proper quality of the soil and recommends suitable fertilisers for the soil through its advisory services. It provides coconut growers with continuous knowledge of technology and educates coconut growers on the proper use of fertilisers.
              <br>
              <br>
              Due to the difficulties in supplying water through orthodox methods, growers do not provide sufficient water for their crops. DIMO Agribusinesses is currently working towards popularising micro-irrigation technology through semi-automatic sub-surface drip irrigation systems in collaboration with the globally renowned Rivulis as an ideal solution in addressing water issues in coconut cultivations. As a result, they also have developed water-soluble fertiliser (Fertigation Fertiliser) mixtures that suit coconut cultivation and can be supplied through the same systems. DIMO Agribusinesses supports in consultancy on selecting the most suitable water system structure for coconut lands, the amount of fertiliser to be applied, the required fertiliser injection flow rate, the size of the tank, and whether a bypass system is required, and not only does it design and install micro-irrigation systems, but it also provides after-sales services. Accordingly, the company is always committed to general maintenance, resolving technical issues, and system improvements on behalf of the farmers.
              <br>
              <br>
              Moreover, for the cost-conscious growers, DIMO Agribusinesses has introduced attractive loan facilities in collaboration with Sarvodaya Development Finance (SDF) as it contributes to increasing the productivity of coconut cultivation by offering a high return on investment (ROI).
              <br>
              <br>
              DIMO has introduced a coconut estate administration service for plantation owners to manage and maintain coconut plantations. The company takes responsibility for the plantation and utilises the expertise of its experienced staff, providing recommendations and agricultural advice with complete maintenance.
              <br>
              <br>
              In addition, DIMO Agribusinesses, through its modern state-of-the-art manufacturing plants, is working towards maximising the benefits of the country’s coconut production by minimising the waste that occurs during coconut consumption through producing value-added products such as virgin coconut oil, cream, coconut milk, and coconut water, to bring foreign exchange to the country through local coconut cultivation.  </span>

          <br>
          <p class="card-text zoom-in" style="font-size: 12px;color: black;margin-left: 0px;">
            Sri Lanka earned $ 930 million from the export of both raw rubber and rubber products in 2023. <span class="dots">...</span>
            <span class="more" style="display:none;"><br><br>Sri Lanka earned $ 930 million from the export of both raw rubber and rubber products in 2023. Out of that the major share, around $ 900 million came from the export of rubber products. In the same year, Sri Lanka was able to produce only 64 million kilograms of natural rubber compelling the industries to import more than 30 million kilograms of natural rubber to the country. Foreign exchange outflow from the country for importation of the shortfall in raw rubber requirement is around $ 50 million.
              <br>
              <br>
              But the country has the potential to save this foreign exchange loss from the country by becoming self-sufficient in its natural rubber requirement. Not only that, the availability of natural rubber in the country will attract more investments to the natural rubber product manufacturing sector of the country further enhancing the foreign exchange earnings and employment opportunities in the country.  </span>
